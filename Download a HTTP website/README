The following cpp code is my first step to coding in computer networking.
This code is to Download a HTTP website by just entering its name and then entering the filename we want to store the Downloaded HTML file.

To run the code:
  1. open this code in suitable text editor.
  2. Save the file with .cpp extention (Eg. file.cpp)
  3. open terminal and type -
        >> g++  file.cpp
        >> ./a.out

The code should run as follows:
    Enter domain name: www.google.com (google was Example)
    IP address of www.google.com is 142.250.195.132
    Message sent to server: GET / HTTP/1.0
  
  
    Message recieved from server: 
  
    Enter Filename:Â google (filename to be saved as google)

After this there should be a file called "google.html" in the same directory as the file is saved in.

Drawbacks to the above code:
  1. Only HTTP websites can be downloaded and not HTTPS.
  2. Only parts in the HTML code will be included while opening the website. 
     For Example: 
          if we open the google html file we notice parts of the website missing from its original.
          This is because we did not account for Downloading parts of the html code that lead to other websites or images etc.
